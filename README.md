## Project Overview

This project is aimed at developing a robust backend program to support the Aggieland Humane Society's current website. The goal is to provide users a simple way to see animals available for adoption, fill out necessary adoption documents, and pay for them via online credit or net banking systems to complete the adoption process.

The project is divided into three sprints, each scheduled for two weeks or 80 hours. The project is scheduled to begin on November 3, 2021, and end on December 15, 2021.
